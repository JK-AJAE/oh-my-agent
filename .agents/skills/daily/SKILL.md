## When to Use
- You are building a real-time voice or multimodal AI application that uses Daily or Pipecat-style transports.
- You need guidance on low-latency audio, video, text, and AI service orchestration in one pipeline.
- You want a capability reference before choosing services, transports, or workflow patterns for an interactive agent.

## Capabilities

Pipecat enables agents to build production-ready voice and multimodal AI applications with real-time processing. Agents can orchestrate complex AI service pipelines that handle audio, video, and text simultaneously while maintaining ultra-low latency (500-800ms round-trip). The framework abstracts away the complexity of coordinating multiple AI services, network transports, and audio processing, allowing agents to focus on application logic.

Key capabilities include:

- Real-time voice conversations with natural turn-taking and interruption handling
- Multimodal processing combining audio, video, images, and text
- Integration with 50+ AI services (LLMs, speech recognition, text-to-speech, vision models)
- Function calling for external API integration and tool use
- Automatic conversation context management with optional summarization
- Multiple transport options (WebRTC, WebSocket, Daily, Twilio, Telnyx, etc.)
- Production deployment across cloud platforms with built-in scaling

### Pipeline Architecture & Frame Processing

Agents can construct pipelines that connect frame processors in sequence to handle real-time data flow:
