# Odoo ↔ Shopify Integration

## Overview

This skill guides you through integrating Odoo with Shopify — syncing your product catalog, real-time inventory levels, incoming orders, and customer data. It covers both using the official Odoo Shopify connector (Enterprise) and building a custom integration via Shopify REST + Odoo XMLRPC APIs.

## When to Use This Skill

- Selling on Shopify while managing inventory in Odoo.
- Automatically creating Odoo sales orders from Shopify purchases.
- Keeping Odoo stock levels in sync with Shopify product availability.
- Mapping Shopify product variants to Odoo product templates.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-shopify-integration` and describe your sync scenario.
2. **Design**: Receive the data flow architecture and field mapping.
3. **Build**: Get code snippets for the Shopify webhook receiver and Odoo API caller.
