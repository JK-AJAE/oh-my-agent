# Landing Page Generator

Generate high-converting landing pages from a product description. Output complete Next.js/React components with multiple section variants, proven copy frameworks, SEO optimization, and performance-first patterns. Not lorem ipsum — actual copy that converts.

**Target:** LCP < 1s · CLS < 0.1 · FID < 100ms  
**Output:** TSX components + Tailwind styles + SEO meta + copy variants

## When to Use
- You need to generate a marketing landing page in Next.js or React.
- The task involves conversion-focused page structure, section variants, Tailwind styling, or SEO-aware copy.
- You want complete landing-page output from a product description rather than isolated UI fragments.

## Core Capabilities

- 5 hero section variants (centered, split, gradient, video-bg, minimal)
- Feature sections (grid, alternating, cards with icons)
- Pricing tables (2–4 tiers with feature lists and toggle)
- FAQ accordion with schema markup
- Testimonials (grid, carousel, single-quote)
- CTA sections (banner, full-page, inline)
- Footer (simple, mega, minimal)
- 4 design styles with Tailwind class sets

## Generation Workflow

Follow these steps in order for every landing page request:

1. **Gather inputs** — collect product name, tagline, audience, pain point, key benefit, pricing tiers, design style, and copy framework using the trigger format below. Ask only for missing fields.
2. **Analyze brand voice** (recommended) — if the user has existing brand content (website copy, blog posts, marketing materials), run it through `marketing-skill/content-production/scripts/brand_voice_analyzer.py` to get a voice profile (formality, tone, perspective). Use the profile to inform design style and copy framework selection:
   - formal + professional → **enterprise** style, **AIDA** framework
   - casual + friendly → **bold-startup** style, **BAB** framework
   - professional + authoritative → **dark-saas** style, **PAS** framework
   - casual + conversational → **clean-minimal** style, **BAB** framework
3. **Select design style** — map the user's choice (or infer from brand voice analysis) to one of the four Tailwind class sets in the Design Style Reference.
4. **Apply copy framework** — write all headline and body copy using the chosen framework (PAS / AIDA / BAB) before generating components. Match the voice profile's formality and tone throughout.
5. **Generate sections in order** — Hero → Features → Pricing → FAQ → Testimonials → CTA → Footer. Skip sections not relevant to the product.
6. **Validate against SEO checklist** — run through every item in the SEO Checklist before outputting final code. Fix any gaps inline.
7. **Output final components** — deliver complete, copy-paste-ready TSX files with all Tailwind classes, SEO meta, and structured data included.
