# React Component Performance

## Overview

Identify render hotspots, isolate expensive updates, and apply targeted optimizations without changing UI behavior.

## When to Use
- When the user asks to profile or improve a slow React component.
- When you need to reduce re-renders, list lag, or expensive render work in React UI.

## Workflow

1. Reproduce or describe the slowdown.
2. Identify what triggers re-renders (state updates, props churn, effects).
3. Isolate fast-changing state from heavy subtrees.
4. Stabilize props and handlers; memoize where it pays off.
5. Reduce expensive work (computation, DOM size, list length).
6. **Validate**: open React DevTools Profiler → record the interaction → inspect the Flamegraph for components rendering longer than ~16 ms → compare against a pre-optimization baseline recording.

## Checklist

- Measure: use React DevTools Profiler or log renders; capture baseline.
- Find churn: identify state updated on a timer, scroll, input, or animation.
- Split: move ticking state into a child; keep heavy lists static.
- Memoize: wrap leaf rows with `memo` only when props are stable.
- Stabilize props: use `useCallback`/`useMemo` for handlers and derived values.
- Avoid derived work in render: precompute, or compute inside memoized helpers.
- Control list size: window/virtualize long lists; avoid rendering hidden items.
- Keys: ensure stable keys; avoid index when order can change.
- Effects: verify dependency arrays; avoid effects that re-run on every render.
- Style/layout: watch for expensive layout thrash or large Markdown/diff renders.

## Optimization Patterns

### Isolate ticking state

Move a timer or animation counter into a child so the parent list never re-renders on each tick.
