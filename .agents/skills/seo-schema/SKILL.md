# Schema Markup Analysis & Generation

## When to Use
- Use when detecting, validating, or generating Schema.org structured data.
- Use when the user asks about JSON-LD, rich results, or markup opportunities.
- Use when schema validation is the main task, rather than a broader SEO audit.

## Detection

1. Scan page source for JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">`
2. Check for Microdata (`itemscope`, `itemprop`)
3. Check for RDFa (`typeof`, `property`)
4. Always recommend JSON-LD as primary format (Google's stated preference)

## Validation

- Check required properties per schema type
- Validate against Google's supported rich result types
- Test for common errors:
  - Missing @context
  - Invalid @type
  - Wrong data types
  - Placeholder text
  - Relative URLs (should be absolute)
  - Invalid date formats
- Flag deprecated types (see below)

## Schema Type Status (as of Feb 2026)

Read `references/schema-types.md` for the full list. Key rules:

### ACTIVE (recommend freely):
Organization, LocalBusiness, SoftwareApplication, WebApplication, Product (with Certification markup as of April 2025), ProductGroup, Offer, Service, Article, BlogPosting, NewsArticle, Review, AggregateRating, BreadcrumbList, WebSite, WebPage, Person, ProfilePage, ContactPage, VideoObject, ImageObject, Event, JobPosting, Course, DiscussionForumPosting

### VIDEO & SPECIALIZED (recommend freely):
BroadcastEvent, Clip, SeekToAction, SoftwareSourceCode

See `schema/templates.json` for ready-to-use JSON-LD templates for these types.

> **JSON-LD and JavaScript rendering:** Per Google's December 2025 JS SEO guidance, structured data injected via JavaScript may face delayed processing. For time-sensitive markup (especially Product, Offer), include JSON-LD in the initial server-rendered HTML.

### RESTRICTED (only for specific sites):
- **FAQ**: ONLY for government and healthcare authority sites (restricted Aug 2023)

### DEPRECATED (never recommend):
- **HowTo**: Rich results removed September 2023
- **SpecialAnnouncement**: Deprecated July 31, 2025
- **CourseInfo, EstimatedSalary, LearningVideo**: Retired June 2025
- **ClaimReview**: Retired from rich results June 2025
- **VehicleListing**: Retired from rich results June 2025
- **Practice Problem**: Retired from rich results late 2025
- **Dataset**: Retired from rich results late 2025
- **Book Actions**: Deprecated then reversed, still functional as of Feb 2026 (historical note)

## Generation

When generating schema for a page:
1. Identify page type from content analysis
2. Select appropriate schema type(s)
3. Generate valid JSON-LD with all required + recommended properties
4. Include only truthful, verifiable data. Use placeholders clearly marked for user to fill
5. Validate output before presenting
