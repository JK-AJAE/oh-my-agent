# AWS Serverless

Specialized skill for building production-ready serverless applications on AWS.
Covers Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS/SNS event-driven patterns,
SAM/CDK deployment, and cold start optimization.

## Principles

- Right-size memory and timeout (measure before optimizing)
- Minimize cold starts for latency-sensitive workloads
- Use SnapStart for Java/.NET functions
- Prefer HTTP API over REST API for simple use cases
- Design for failure with DLQs and retries
- Keep deployment packages small
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement structured logging with correlation IDs

## Patterns

### Lambda Handler Pattern

Proper Lambda function structure with error handling

**When to use**: Any Lambda function implementation,API handlers, event processors, scheduled tasks
