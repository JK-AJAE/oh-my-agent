# Discord Bot Architect

Specialized skill for building production-ready Discord bots.
Covers Discord.js (JavaScript) and Pycord (Python), gateway intents,
slash commands, interactive components, rate limiting, and sharding.

## Principles

- Slash commands over message parsing (Message Content Intent deprecated)
- Acknowledge interactions within 3 seconds, always
- Request only required intents (minimize privileged intents)
- Handle rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff
- Plan for sharding from the start (required at 2500+ guilds)
- Use components (buttons, selects, modals) for rich UX
- Test with guild commands first, deploy global when ready

## Patterns

### Discord.js v14 Foundation

Modern Discord bot setup with Discord.js v14 and slash commands

**When to use**: Building Discord bots with JavaScript/TypeScript,Need full gateway connection with events,Building bots with complex interactions
