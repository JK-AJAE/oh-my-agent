# DBOS Python Best Practices

Guide for building reliable, fault-tolerant Python applications with DBOS durable workflows.

## When to Use
Reference these guidelines when:
- Adding DBOS to existing Python code
- Creating workflows and steps
- Using queues for concurrency control
- Implementing workflow communication (events, messages, streams)
- Configuring and launching DBOS applications
- Using DBOSClient from external applications
- Testing DBOS applications

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Lifecycle | CRITICAL | `lifecycle-` |
| 2 | Workflow | CRITICAL | `workflow-` |
| 3 | Step | HIGH | `step-` |
| 4 | Queue | HIGH | `queue-` |
| 5 | Communication | MEDIUM | `comm-` |
| 6 | Pattern | MEDIUM | `pattern-` |
| 7 | Testing | LOW-MEDIUM | `test-` |
| 8 | Client | MEDIUM | `client-` |
| 9 | Advanced | LOW | `advanced-` |

## Critical Rules

### DBOS Configuration and Launch

A DBOS application MUST configure and launch DBOS inside its main function:
