# Running Workloads on Hugging Face Jobs

## Overview

Run any workload on fully managed Hugging Face infrastructure. No local setup required—jobs run on cloud CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs and can persist results to the Hugging Face Hub.

**Common use cases:**
- **Data Processing** - Transform, filter, or analyze large datasets
- **Batch Inference** - Run inference on thousands of samples
- **Experiments & Benchmarks** - Reproducible ML experiments
- **Model Training** - Fine-tune models (see `model-trainer` skill for TRL-specific training)
- **Synthetic Data Generation** - Generate datasets using LLMs
- **Development & Testing** - Test code without local GPU setup
- **Scheduled Jobs** - Automate recurring tasks

**For model training specifically:** See the `model-trainer` skill for TRL-based training workflows.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users want to:
- Run Python workloads on cloud infrastructure
- Execute jobs without local GPU/TPU setup
- Process data at scale
- Run batch inference or experiments
- Schedule recurring tasks
- Use GPUs/TPUs for any workload
- Persist results to the Hugging Face Hub

## Key Directives

When assisting with jobs:

1. **ALWAYS use `hf_jobs()` MCP tool** - Submit jobs using `hf_jobs("uv", {...})` or `hf_jobs("run", {...})`. The `script` parameter accepts Python code directly. Do NOT save to local files unless the user explicitly requests it. Pass the script content as a string to `hf_jobs()`.

2. **Always handle authentication** - Jobs that interact with the Hub require `HF_TOKEN` via secrets. See Token Usage section below.

3. **Provide job details after submission** - After submitting, provide job ID, monitoring URL, estimated time, and note that the user can request status checks later.

4. **Set appropriate timeouts** - Default 30min may be insufficient for long-running tasks.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting any job, verify:

### ✅ **Account & Authentication**
- Hugging Face Account with [Pro](https://hf.co/pro), [Team](https://hf.co/enterprise), or [Enterprise](https://hf.co/enterprise) plan (Jobs require paid plan)
- Authenticated login: Check with `hf_whoami()`
- **HF_TOKEN for Hub Access** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Required for any Hub operations (push models/datasets, download private repos, etc.)
- Token must have appropriate permissions (read for downloads, write for uploads)

### ✅ **Token Usage** (See Token Usage section for details)

**When tokens are required:**
- Pushing models/datasets to Hub
- Accessing private repositories
- Using Hub APIs in scripts
- Any authenticated Hub operations

**How to provide tokens:**
