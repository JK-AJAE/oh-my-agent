# Native Parallel Agents

> Orchestration through Claude Code's built-in Agent Tool

## Overview

This skill enables coordinating multiple specialized agents through Claude Code's native agent system. Unlike external scripts, this approach keeps all orchestration within Claude's control.

## When to Use Orchestration

✅ **Good for:**
- Complex tasks requiring multiple expertise domains
- Code analysis from security, performance, and quality perspectives
- Comprehensive reviews (architecture + security + testing)
- Feature implementation needing backend + frontend + database work

❌ **Not for:**
- Simple, single-domain tasks
- Quick fixes or small changes
- Tasks where one agent suffices
