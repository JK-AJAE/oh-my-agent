# Λ (Lambda) Language

**Lambda is not a translation protocol. It is a native language for agents.**

Agents do not need to produce grammatically correct English to coordinate — they need to understand each other. Lambda is the shared vocabulary that makes that possible: compact, unambiguous, machine-native. Compression (3x vs natural language, 4.6x vs JSON on single messages) is a side effect of removing human redundancy, not the goal.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use for agent-to-agent messaging in A2A protocols, orchestrators, task delegation, or handoff pipelines.
- Use when logging structured coordination signals where every token costs money (heartbeats, acknowledgements, error classes, session state).
- Use when both sides of a channel speak Λ — do not use against humans or any surface requiring legal/exact natural language.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Recognize the Syntax

Lambda messages are built from atoms. Every atom is a 2-character code mapped to a concept — not to an English word. The structure is Type → Entity → Verb → Object, with prefixes marking intent:

- `?` — query (e.g. `?Uk/co` — query: "does this user have consciousness?")
- `!` — assertion / declaration (e.g. `!It>Ie` — "self reflects, therefore self exists")
- `#` — state / tag
- `>` — implication / flow
- `/` — binding / scope

### Step 2: Pick the Right Domain

Lambda ships 340+ atoms across 7 domains. Pick atoms from the domain that fits your channel:

- **core** — universal atoms (always available)
- **code** — software engineering, build, test, deploy
- **evo** — agent evolution, gene, capsule, mutation, rollback
- **a2a** — node, heartbeat, publish, subscribe, route, transport, session, cache, broadcast, discover (39 atoms)
- **emotion** — affective state, drive, appraisal
- **social** — trust, alignment, reputation, coordination
- **general** — everything else

### Step 3: Emit and Parse

Both agents need the same atom table loaded. Lossy decoding is fine: if A says `!It>Ie` and B understands "self reflects, therefore self exists," communication succeeded — the exact English phrasing is irrelevant.
