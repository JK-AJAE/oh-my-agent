# n8n Validation Expert

Expert guide for interpreting and fixing n8n validation errors.

## When to Use
- You need to interpret or fix validation errors in an n8n workflow.
- The task involves `missing_required`, `invalid_value`, expression failures, or iterative validate-fix loops.
- You want concrete remediation guidance for workflow validation output.

## Validation Philosophy

**Validate early, validate often**

Validation is typically iterative:
- Expect validation feedback loops
- Usually 2-3 validate → fix cycles
- Average: 23s thinking about errors, 58s fixing them

**Key insight**: Validation is an iterative process, not one-shot!

## Error Severity Levels

### 1. Errors (Must Fix)
**Blocks workflow execution** - Must be resolved before activation

**Types**:
- `missing_required` - Required field not provided
- `invalid_value` - Value doesn't match allowed options
- `type_mismatch` - Wrong data type (string instead of number)
- `invalid_reference` - Referenced node doesn't exist
- `invalid_expression` - Expression syntax error

**Example**:
