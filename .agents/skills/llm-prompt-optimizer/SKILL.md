# LLM Prompt Optimizer

## Overview

This skill transforms weak, vague, or inconsistent prompts into precision-engineered instructions that reliably produce high-quality outputs from any LLM (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, Llama, etc.). It applies systematic prompt engineering frameworks — from zero-shot to few-shot, chain-of-thought, and structured output patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a prompt returns inconsistent, vague, or hallucinated results
- Use when you need structured/JSON output from an LLM reliably
- Use when designing system prompts for AI agents or chatbots
- Use when you want to reduce token usage without sacrificing quality
- Use when implementing chain-of-thought reasoning for complex tasks
- Use when prompts work on one model but fail on another

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Diagnose the Weak Prompt

Before optimizing, identify which problem pattern applies:

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too vague | Generic, unhelpful answers | Add role + context + constraints |
| No structure | Unformatted, hard-to-parse output | Specify output format explicitly |
| Hallucination | Confident wrong answers | Add "say I don't know if unsure" |
| Inconsistent | Different answers each run | Add few-shot examples |
| Too long | Verbose, padded responses | Add length constraints |

### 2. Apply the RSCIT Framework

Every optimized prompt should have:

- **R** — **Role**: Who is the AI in this interaction?
- **S** — **Situation**: What context does it need?
- **C** — **Constraints**: What are the rules and limits?
- **I** — **Instructions**: What exactly should it do?
- **T** — **Template**: What should the output look like?
