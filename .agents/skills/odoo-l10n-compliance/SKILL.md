# Odoo Localization & Compliance (l10n)

## Overview

Odoo provides localization modules (`l10n_*`) for 80+ countries that configure the correct chart of accounts, tax types, and fiscal reporting. This skill helps you install and configure the right localization, set up country-specific e-invoicing (Mexico CFDI, Italy FatturaPA, Poland SAF-T), and ensure fiscal compliance.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up Odoo for a company in a specific country (Mexico, Italy, Spain, US, etc.).
- Configuring country-required e-invoicing (electronic invoice submission to tax authorities).
- Setting up VAT/GST/IVA tax rules with correct fiscal positions.
- Generating required fiscal reports (VAT return, SAF-T, DIAN report).

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-l10n-compliance` and specify your country and Odoo version.
2. **Install**: Get the exact localization module and configuration steps.
3. **Configure**: Receive tax code setup, fiscal position rules, and reporting guidance.
