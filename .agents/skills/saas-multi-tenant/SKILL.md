# SaaS Multi-Tenant Architecture

## When to Use This Skill

- The user is building a SaaS application where multiple customers share the same database
- The user asks about tenant isolation, row-level security, or data leakage prevention
- The user needs to scope every database query to a specific tenant without manual WHERE clauses
- The user asks about shared-schema vs schema-per-tenant vs database-per-tenant tradeoffs
- The user is implementing admin endpoints that must access data across tenants
- The user needs to add `tenant_id` columns to an existing single-tenant application
- The user asks about PostgreSQL RLS policies for tenant isolation
- The user is building tenant-aware middleware in Express, Fastify, or Next.js API routes

Do NOT use this skill when:
- The user is building a single-user application with no shared infrastructure
- The user asks about authentication only without tenant scoping (use an auth skill instead)
- The user needs general database schema design without multi-tenancy requirements

## Core Workflow

1. Determine the tenancy model. Ask the user about their scale expectations and isolation requirements. For most SaaS apps under 1000 tenants, shared-schema with a `tenant_id` column on every table is the correct default. Schema-per-tenant adds operational overhead (migrations run N times). Database-per-tenant is only justified when tenants have regulatory data residency requirements.

2. Add `tenant_id` to every tenant-scoped table. The column must be `NOT NULL`, type `UUID` or `TEXT`, and included in every composite index. Never allow a tenant-scoped table to exist without this column — a missing `tenant_id` is a data leak waiting to happen.

3. Set up PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS). Create a policy on each tenant-scoped table that filters rows by `current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')`. This acts as a database-level safety net — even if application code forgets a WHERE clause, RLS blocks cross-tenant reads.

4. Build tenant-aware middleware. At the start of every request, extract the `tenant_id` from the authenticated session or JWT claims. Set it on the database connection using `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id = '...'` inside a transaction. Every subsequent query in that request inherits the tenant scope automatically.

5. Scope all ORM queries by tenant. If using Prisma, apply a global middleware that injects `where: { tenantId }` into every `findMany`, `findFirst`, `update`, and `delete` call. If using Drizzle, create a base query builder that includes the tenant filter. Never rely on developers remembering to add the filter manually.

6. Handle tenant-aware migrations. Every new table migration must include `tenant_id` as a column. Write a linting rule or CI check that rejects any migration creating a table without `tenant_id` unless the table is explicitly marked as global (e.g., `plans`, `feature_flags`).

7. Build cross-tenant admin routes separately. Admin endpoints that aggregate data across tenants must bypass RLS explicitly using `SET LOCAL role = 'admin_bypass'` or a dedicated database role. These routes must be protected by a separate admin authentication flow — never reuse tenant user sessions for admin access.

8. Implement tenant provisioning. When a new customer signs up, create their tenant record, seed default data (roles, settings, onboarding state), and assign the founding user. Wrap this in a database transaction so partial provisioning never leaves orphan records.
