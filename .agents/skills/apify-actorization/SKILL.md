# Apify Actorization

Actorization converts existing software into reusable serverless applications compatible with the Apify platform. Actors are programs packaged as Docker images that accept well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce structured JSON output.

## Quick Start

1. Run `apify init` in project root
2. Wrap code with SDK lifecycle (see language-specific section below)
3. Configure `.actor/input_schema.json`
4. Test with `apify run --input '{"key": "value"}'`
5. Deploy with `apify push`

## When to Use This Skill

- Converting an existing project to run on Apify platform
- Adding Apify SDK integration to a project
- Wrapping a CLI tool or script as an Actor
- Migrating a Crawlee project to Apify

## Prerequisites

Verify `apify` CLI is installed:
