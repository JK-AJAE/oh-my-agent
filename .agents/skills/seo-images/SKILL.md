# Image Optimization Analysis

## When to Use
- Use when auditing image SEO, alt text, file sizes, formats, or lazy loading.
- Use when the user wants image-specific performance recommendations.
- Use when checking media quality signals that affect both SEO and Core Web Vitals.

## Checks

### Alt Text
- Present on all `<img>` elements (except decorative: `role="presentation"`)
- Descriptive: describes the image content, not "image.jpg" or "photo"
- Includes relevant keywords where natural, not keyword-stuffed
- Length: 10-125 characters

**Good examples:**
- "Professional plumber repairing kitchen sink faucet"
- "Red 2024 Toyota Camry sedan front view"
- "Team meeting in modern office conference room"

**Bad examples:**
- "image.jpg" (filename, not description)
- "plumber plumbing plumber services" (keyword stuffing)
- "Click here" (not descriptive)

### File Size

**Tiered thresholds by image category:**

| Image Category | Target | Warning | Critical |
|----------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Thumbnails | < 50KB | > 100KB | > 200KB |
| Content images | < 100KB | > 200KB | > 500KB |
| Hero/banner images | < 200KB | > 300KB | > 700KB |

Recommend compression to target thresholds where possible without quality loss.

### Format
| Format | Browser Support | Use Case |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| WebP | 97%+ | Default recommendation |
| AVIF | 92%+ | Best compression, newer |
| JPEG | 100% | Fallback for photos |
| PNG | 100% | Graphics with transparency |
| SVG | 100% | Icons, logos, illustrations |

Recommend WebP/AVIF over JPEG/PNG. Check for `<picture>` element with format fallbacks.

#### Recommended `<picture>` Element Pattern

Use progressive enhancement with the most efficient format first:
