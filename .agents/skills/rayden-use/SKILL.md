# Rayden UI Design Skill

## Overview

Build and maintain Rayden UI components and screens directly in Figma using the Figma MCP. The skill enforces the Rayna UI design system — resolved design tokens, craft rules, anti-pattern detection, and visual validation — so every output is mechanically correct and visually premium. Supports three style modes (conservative, balanced, expressive) and includes a dedicated subagent for full-page screen composition.

## When to Use This Skill

- You need to build a new Rayden UI component with all its variants in Figma
- You're composing a full screen (dashboard, landing page, auth form, settings, data table) from Rayden patterns
- You want to audit an existing Figma file for design system compliance
- You need to add new variants to an existing Figma component
- You're syncing React component updates back to Figma

## How It Works

1. **Verifies environment** — Checks Figma MCP connection and write access via `whoami`
2. **Loads component data** — Reads Rayden component specs, anatomy, and tokens from the `@raydenui/ai` MCP server or installed package
3. **Loads craft rules** — Reads supporting files: resolved token values, craft rules, anti-patterns, and screen layout patterns
4. **Identifies task type** — Determines if building a single component, composing a screen, auditing, or adding variants
5. **Applies style mode** — Adjusts spacing, shadow, typography, and visual weight based on conservative/balanced/expressive mode
6. **Builds with helpers** — Generates Figma Plugin API code using mandatory helper functions (hexToRgb, loadFonts, applyShadow, applyBorder) with auto layout on every frame
7. **Visual validation** — Takes screenshots after each build stage and validates against 8 acceptance criteria (alignment, spacing, color accuracy, hierarchy, radius, shadow, primary action count)
