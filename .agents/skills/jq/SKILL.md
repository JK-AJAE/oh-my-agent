# jq — JSON Querying and Transformation

## Overview

`jq` is the standard CLI tool for querying and reshaping JSON. This skill covers practical, expert-level usage: filtering deeply nested data, transforming structures, aggregating values, and composing `jq` into shell pipelines. Every example is copy-paste ready for real workflows.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when parsing JSON output from APIs, CLI tools (AWS, GitHub, kubectl, docker), or log files
- Use when transforming JSON structure (rename keys, flatten arrays, group records)
- Use when the user needs `jq` inside a bash script or one-liner
- Use when explaining what a complex `jq` expression does

## How It Works

`jq` takes a filter expression and applies it to JSON input. Filters compose with pipes (`|`), and `jq` handles arrays, objects, strings, numbers, booleans, and `null` natively.
