# OSS Hunter 🎯

A precision skill for agents to find, analyze, and strategize for high-impact Open Source contributions. This skill helps you become a top-tier contributor by identifying the most "mergeable" and influential issues in trending repositories.

## When to Use
- Use when the user asks to find open source issues to work on.
- Use when searching for "help wanted" or "good first issue" tasks in specific domains like AI or Web3.
- Use to generate a "Contribution Dossier" with ready-to-execute strategies for trending projects.

## Quick Start

Ask your agent:
- "Find me some help-wanted issues in trending AI repositories."
- "Hunt for bug fixes in langchain-ai/langchain that are suitable for a quick PR."
- "Generate a contribution dossier for the most recent trending projects on GitHub."

## Workflow

When hunting for contributions, the agent follows this multi-stage protocol:

### Phase 1: Repository Discovery
Use `web_search` or `gh api` to find trending repositories.
Focus on:
- Stars > 1000
- Recent activity (pushed within 24 hours)
- Relevant topics (AI, Agentic, Web3, Tooling)

### Phase 2: Issue Extraction
Search for specific labels:
- `help-wanted`
- `good-first-issue`
- `bug`
- `v1` / `roadmap`
