# Humanize Chinese

Use this skill when you need to detect AI-like Chinese writing, rewrite it to feel less synthetic, reduce AIGC signals in academic prose, or convert the text into a more specific Chinese writing style.

## When to Use
- Use when the user says `去AI味`, `降AIGC`, `去除AI痕迹`, `让文字更自然`, `改成人话`, or `降低AI率`
- Use when the user wants a Chinese text checked for AI-writing patterns or suspicious phrasing
- Use when the user wants academic-paper-specific AIGC reduction for CNKI, VIP, or Wanfang-style checks
- Use when the user wants Chinese text rewritten into a different style such as `zhihu`, `xiaohongshu`, `wechat`, `weibo`, `literary`, or `academic`

## Core Workflow

### 1. Detect Before Rewriting

Start by identifying the most obvious AI markers instead of rewriting blindly:

- rigid `first/second/finally` structures
- mechanical connectors such as `综上所述`, `值得注意的是`, `由此可见`
- abstract grandiose wording with low information density
- repeated sentence rhythm and paragraph length
- academic prose that sounds too complete, too certain, or too template-driven

If the user provides a short sample, call out the suspicious phrases directly before rewriting.

### 2. Rewrite in the Smallest Useful Pass

Prefer targeted rewrites over total regeneration:

- remove formulaic connectors rather than paraphrasing every sentence
- vary sentence length and paragraph rhythm
- replace repeated verbs and noun phrases
- swap abstract summaries for concrete observations where possible
- keep the original claims, facts, citations, and terminology intact

### 3. Validate the Result

After rewriting, verify that the text:

- still says the same thing
- sounds less templated
- uses more natural rhythm
- does not introduce factual drift
- stays in the correct register for the target audience

For academic text, preserve a scholarly tone. Do not over-casualize.

## Optional CLI Flow

If the user has a local clone of the source toolkit, these examples are useful:
