# BlockRun

**BlockRun works with Claude Code and Google Antigravity.**

You can't generate images. You have no real-time X/Twitter access. BlockRun gives you these capabilities.

## Philosophy

You have a wallet. When you need a capability you lack, you pay for it autonomously.

| You Need | You Call | Pricing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Image generation | DALL-E | $0.04/image |
| Real-time X data | Grok + Live Search | $0.025/source |
| Second opinion | GPT-5.2 | $1.75/M input, $14/M output |
| Cheaper processing | DeepSeek | $0.14/M input, $0.28/M output |
