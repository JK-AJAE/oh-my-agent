# Robius Matrix SDK Integration Skill

Best practices for integrating external APIs with Makepad applications based on Robrix and Moly codebases.

**Source codebases:**
- **Robrix**: Matrix SDK integration - sliding sync, timeline subscriptions, real-time updates
- **Moly**: OpenAI/LLM API integration - SSE streaming, MCP protocol, multi-provider support

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Integrating Matrix SDK with Makepad
- Building a Matrix client with Makepad
- Implementing Matrix features (rooms, timelines, messages)
- Handling Matrix SDK async operations in UI
- Keywords: matrix-sdk, matrix client, robrix, matrix timeline, matrix room, sliding sync

## Overview

Robrix uses the `matrix-sdk` and `matrix-sdk-ui` crates to connect to Matrix homeservers. The key architectural decisions:

1. **Sliding Sync**: Uses native sliding sync for efficient room list updates
2. **Separate Runtime**: Tokio runtime runs Matrix operations, Makepad handles UI
3. **Request/Response Pattern**: UI sends requests, receives actions/updates back
4. **Per-Room Background Tasks**: Each room has dedicated timeline subscriber task
