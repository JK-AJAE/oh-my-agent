# React State Management

Comprehensive guide to modern React state management patterns, from local component state to global stores and server state synchronization.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to react state management
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Setting up global state management in a React app
- Choosing between Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Jotai
- Managing server state with React Query or SWR
- Implementing optimistic updates
- Debugging state-related issues
- Migrating from legacy Redux to modern patterns

## Core Concepts

### 1. State Categories

| Type | Description | Solutions |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Local State** | Component-specific, UI state | useState, useReducer |
| **Global State** | Shared across components | Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai |
| **Server State** | Remote data, caching | React Query, SWR, RTK Query |
| **URL State** | Route parameters, search | React Router, nuqs |
| **Form State** | Input values, validation | React Hook Form, Formik |
