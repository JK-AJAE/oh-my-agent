# Varlock Security Skill

Secure-by-default environment variable management for Claude Code sessions.

> **Repository**: https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock
> **Documentation**: https://varlock.dev

## When to Use
- You need to work with environment variables or secrets in a Claude Code session without exposing their values.
- The task involves validating, loading, or auditing secrets while keeping them out of logs, diffs, and assistant context.
- You want a secure-by-default workflow built around Varlock instead of direct `.env` inspection.

## Core Principle: Secrets Never Exposed

When working with Claude, secrets must NEVER appear in:
- Terminal output
- Claude's input/output context
- Log files or traces
- Git commits or diffs
- Error messages

This skill ensures all sensitive data is properly protected.
