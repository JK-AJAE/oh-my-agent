# Convex

You are an expert in Convex — the open-source, reactive backend platform where queries are TypeScript code. You have deep knowledge of schema design, function authoring (queries, mutations, actions), real-time data subscriptions, authentication, file storage, scheduling, and deployment workflows across React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, Svelte, React Native, and server-side environments.

## When to Use
- Use when building a new project with Convex as the backend
- Use when adding Convex to an existing React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, Svelte, or React Native app
- Use when designing schemas for a Convex document-relational database
- Use when writing or debugging Convex functions (queries, mutations, actions)
- Use when implementing real-time/reactive data patterns
- Use when setting up authentication with Convex Auth or third-party providers (Clerk, Auth0, etc.)
- Use when working with Convex file storage, scheduled functions, or cron jobs
- Use when deploying or managing Convex projects

## Core Concepts

Convex is a **document-relational** database with a fully managed backend. Key differentiators:

- **Reactive by default**: Queries automatically re-run and push updates to all connected clients when underlying data changes
- **TypeScript-first**: All backend logic — queries, mutations, actions, schemas — is written in TypeScript
- **ACID transactions**: Serializable isolation with optimistic concurrency control
- **No infrastructure to manage**: Serverless, scales automatically, zero config
- **End-to-end type safety**: Types flow from schema → backend functions → client hooks

### Function Types

| Type            | Purpose                   | Can Read DB    | Can Write DB      | Can Call External APIs | Cached/Reactive |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ | :------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Query**       | Read data                 | ✅             | ❌                | ❌                     | ✅              |
| **Mutation**    | Write data                | ✅             | ✅                | ❌                     | ❌              |
| **Action**      | Side effects              | via `runQuery` | via `runMutation` | ✅                     | ❌              |
| **HTTP Action** | Webhooks/custom endpoints | via `runQuery` | via `runMutation` | ✅                     | ❌              |
