## When to Use
- You need to get started with Makepad or understand basic app structure and boilerplate.
- The task involves project setup, `live_design!`, `app_main!`, or first-screen application wiring.
- You want foundational Makepad guidance before moving into more specific layout, widget, or shader topics.

## Documentation

Refer to the local files for detailed documentation:
- `./references/app-structure.md` - Complete app boilerplate and structure
- `./references/event-handling.md` - Event handling patterns
