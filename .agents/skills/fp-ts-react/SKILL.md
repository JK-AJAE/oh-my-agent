# Functional Programming in React

Practical patterns for React apps. No jargon, just code that works.

## When to Use This Skill

- When building React apps with fp-ts for type-safe state management
- When handling loading/error/success states in data fetching
- When implementing form validation with error accumulation
- When using React 18/19 or Next.js 14/15 with functional patterns

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `Option` | Value might be missing (user not loaded yet) |
| `Either` | Operation might fail (form validation) |
| `TaskEither` | Async operation might fail (API calls) |
| `RemoteData` | Need to show loading/error/success states |
| `pipe` | Chaining multiple transformations |

## 1. State with Option (Maybe It's There, Maybe Not)

Use `Option` instead of `null | undefined` for clearer intent.

### Basic Pattern
