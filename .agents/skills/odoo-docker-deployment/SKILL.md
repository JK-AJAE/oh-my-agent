# Odoo Docker Deployment

## Overview

This skill provides a complete, production-ready Docker setup for Odoo, including PostgreSQL, persistent file storage, environment variable configuration, and an optional Nginx reverse proxy with SSL. It covers both development and production configurations.

## When to Use This Skill

- Spinning up a local Odoo development environment with Docker.
- Deploying Odoo to a VPS or cloud server (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).
- Troubleshooting Odoo container startup failures or database connection errors.
- Adding a reverse proxy with SSL to an existing Odoo Docker setup.

## How It Works

1. **Activate**: Mention `@odoo-docker-deployment` and describe your deployment scenario.
2. **Generate**: Receive a complete `docker-compose.yml` and `odoo.conf` ready to run.
3. **Debug**: Describe your container error and get a diagnosis with a fix.

## Examples

### Example 1: Production docker-compose.yml
