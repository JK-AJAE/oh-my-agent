## When to Use This Skill

- Use when skills are not triggering as expected or seem broken
- Use when you want to audit and improve your skill library's quality
- Use when you want to understand which skills are underperforming or wasting context tokens

## Rules

- **Read-only**: never modify skill files. Only output report.
- **All 8 dimensions**: do not skip any. If data is insufficient, report "N/A — insufficient session data" rather than omitting.
- **Quantify**: "you had 12 research tasks last week but the skill never triggered" beats "you often do research".
- **Suggest, don't prescribe**: give specific wording suggestions for description improvements, but frame as suggestions.
- **Show evidence**: for undertrigger claims, quote the actual user message that should have triggered the skill.
- **Evidence-based suggestions**: when suggesting description rewrites, cite the specific research finding that motivates the change (e.g., "front-load trigger keywords — MCP study shows 3.6x selection rate improvement").

## Overview

Analyze skills using **historical session data + static quality checks**, output a diagnostic report with P0/P1/P2 prioritized fixes. Scores each skill on a 5-point composite scale across 8 dimensions.

CSO (Claude/Agent Search Optimization) = writing skill descriptions so agents select the right skill at the right time. This skill checks for CSO violations.

## Usage

- `/optimize-skill` → scan all skills
- `/optimize-skill my-skill` → single skill
- `/optimize-skill skill-a skill-b` → multiple specified skills

## Data Sources

Auto-detect the current agent platform and scan the corresponding paths:

| Source | Claude Code | Codex | Shared |
|--------|------------|-------|--------|
| Session transcripts | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | — |
| Skill files | `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `~/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` |

**Platform detection:** Check which directories exist. Scan all available sources — a user may have both Claude Code and Codex installed.
