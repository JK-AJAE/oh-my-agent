# Playwright Java – Advanced Test Automation

## Overview

This skill produces production-quality, enterprise-grade Playwright Java test code.
It enforces the Page Object Model (POM), strict locator strategies, thread-safe parallel
execution, and full Allure reporting integration. Targets Java 17+ and Playwright 1.44+.

Supporting reference files are available for deeper topics:

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Maven POM, ConfigReader, Docker/CI setup | `references/config.md` |
| Component pattern, dropdowns, uploads, waits | `references/page-objects.md` |
| Full assertion API, soft assertions, visual testing | `references/assertions.md` |
| Fixtures, test data factory, auth state, retry | `references/fixtures.md` |
| Drop-in base class templates | `templates/BaseTest.java`, `templates/BasePage.java` |

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when scaffolding a new Playwright Java project from scratch
- Use when writing Page Object classes or JUnit 5 test classes
- Use when the user asks about cross-browser testing, parallel execution, or Allure reports
- Use when fixing flaky tests or replacing `Thread.sleep()` with proper waits
- Use when setting up Playwright in CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker)
- Use when combining API calls and UI assertions in a single test (hybrid testing)
- Use when the user mentions "POM pattern", "BrowserContext", "Playwright fixtures", or "traces"

## How It Works

### Step 1: Decide the Approach

Use this matrix to pick the right pattern before writing any code:

| User Request | Approach |
|---|---|
| New project from scratch | Full scaffold — see `references/config.md` |
| Single feature test | POM page class + JUnit5 test class |
| API + UI hybrid | `APIRequestContext` alongside `Page` |
| Cross-browser | `@MethodSource` parameterized over browser names |
| Flaky test fix | Replace `sleep` with `waitFor` / `waitForResponse` |
| CI integration | `playwright install --with-deps` in pipeline |
| Parallel execution | `junit-platform.properties` + `ThreadLocal` |
| Rich reporting | Allure + Playwright trace + video recording |

### Step 2: Scaffold the Project Structure

Always use this layout when creating a new project:
