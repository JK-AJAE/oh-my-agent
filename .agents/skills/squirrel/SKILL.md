# Squirrel — Full-Cycle Software Development Skill

## Overview

Squirrel is a full-cycle AI coding skill that works across 9 AI coding agents. It auto-detects project state (greenfield, in-progress, or mature) and adapts its 8-phase engineering pipeline accordingly. Instead of a one-size-fits-all workflow, it figures out where the project actually is and jumps in at exactly the right point.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when starting a new project from scratch (greenfield)
- Use when improving an existing codebase (in-progress or mature)
- Use when fixing bugs, adding features, or refactoring
- Use when adding tests, linting, or CI/CD to a project
- Use when writing production-grade documentation
- Use when the user says "build me", "fix this", "squirrel this project", or any multi-step development task

## How It Works

### Step 0: Detect Mode

Squirrel classifies the project directory:

| Signal | Mode | Entry Point |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Empty directory | Greenfield | All 8 phases from scratch |
| Source files, no tests/docs | In-Progress | Audit first, then improve |
| Source + tests + CI + README | Mature | Targeted improvements |
| "fix this bug / add feature" | Targeted | Scoped work only |

### The 8-Phase Pipeline

1. **Discover** — Understand the project (audit existing code or gather requirements)
2. **Plan** — Concrete task list with dependencies and done-criteria
3. **Build** — Write or modify code (parallel sub-agents when supported)
4. **Test** — Run existing tests, write new ones, 70%+ coverage target
5. **Bug Hunt** — Static analysis + manual review
6. **Polish** — Lint, format, type check, remove dead code
7. **Document** — README + inline docs (update existing, don't overwrite)
8. **Ship** — Final checklist: tests green, no secrets, CI configured

### Failure Recovery (3-Strike Rule)

1. **Strike 1:** Fix the specific error. Run tests. Move on.
2. **Strike 2:** Re-read the code. Try a different approach.
3. **Strike 3:** STOP. Revert. Document what failed. Ask the user.

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a REST API
