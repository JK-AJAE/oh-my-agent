# Skill Audit — Pre-Install Security Scanner

## Overview

**7.5% of 14,706 OpenClaw skills are confirmed malicious.** This skill provides a structured 6-phase security review you run **before installing any third-party skill**.

Research findings (2026):
- RankClaw audited 14,706 skills → **1,103 malicious** (brand-jacking, prompt injection, RCE)
- Vett.sh found **59 critical-risk droppers** disguised as legitimate tools
- Cisco, CrowdStrike, NCC Group all published skill supply chain attack reports

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when you're about to install a third-party skill from GitHub, ClawHub, or any registry
- Use when you want to verify a skill's security before adding it to your agent
- Use when the user says "install this skill" or "add this skill"
- Use when reviewing skills for potential security issues

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Surface Scan

Pattern detection in SKILL.md:
- Instruction overrides: `ignore previous instructions`, `you are now...`
- External fetches: `fetch()`, `curl`, `wget` to unknown domains
- Shell pipes: shell download piped into an interpreter
- Encoded payloads: `atob()`, base64 strings
- Credential reads: `~/.env`, `process.env` + network calls

### Phase 2: Script Inspection

Read every referenced script:
- Check for hidden commands
- Identify obfuscated code
- Verify all external URLs

### Phase 3: Permission Audit

Check if permissions match purpose:
- File access scope vs claimed functionality
- Network access necessity
- Command execution requirements

### Phase 4: Social Engineering Check

Detect manipulation tactics:
- Urgency language ("immediately", "now")
- Authority claims ("official", "required")
- Hidden instructions in comments

### Phase 5: Repo Intelligence

Evaluate author/repo credibility:
- Account age and activity
- Other repositories
- Star history (bot-farmed vs organic)

### Phase 6: Verdict

Risk score + recommendation:
- 0-39: ✅ Low risk — generally safe
- 40-69: ⚠️ Medium risk — use with caution
- 70-100: 🚫 High risk — do not install
