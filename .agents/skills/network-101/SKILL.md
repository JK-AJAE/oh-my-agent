# Network 101

## Purpose

Configure and test common network services (HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, SMB) for penetration testing lab environments. Enable hands-on practice with service enumeration, log analysis, and security testing against properly configured target systems.

## Inputs/Prerequisites

- Windows Server or Linux system for hosting services
- Kali Linux or similar for testing
- Administrative access to target system
- Basic networking knowledge (IP addressing, ports)
- Firewall access for port configuration

## Outputs/Deliverables

- Configured HTTP/HTTPS web server
- SNMP service with accessible communities
- SMB file shares with various permission levels
- Captured logs for analysis
- Documented enumeration results

## Core Workflow

### 1. Configure HTTP Server (Port 80)

Set up a basic HTTP web server for testing:

**Windows IIS Setup:**
1. Open IIS Manager (Internet Information Services)
