# Devcontainer Setup Skill

Creates a pre-configured devcontainer with Claude Code and language-specific tooling.

## When to Use
- User asks to "set up a devcontainer" or "add devcontainer support"
- User wants a sandboxed Claude Code development environment
- User needs isolated development environments with persistent configuration

## When NOT to Use

- User already has a devcontainer configuration and just needs modifications
- User is asking about general Docker or container questions
- User wants to deploy production containers (this is for development only)

## Workflow
